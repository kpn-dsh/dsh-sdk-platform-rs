# Dsh-sdk-platform-rs
This repository contains the Rust SDK for the Data Sharing Hub (DSH) platform and some related utility crates.

## Dsh_sdk
The [dsh_sdk](dsh_sdk) is a Rust library that provides a simple interface to interact with the DSH platform. The SDK is used to create and manage data streams, and to send data to the DSH platform.
See [dsh_sdk/README.md](dsh_sdk/README.md) for more information.

## Dsh_rest_api_client
A code genereated client for the DSH REST API. The client is generated by Progenitor using the OpenAPI specification of the DSH REST API. The client is used to interact with the DSH REST API.

## Example DSH Service
The [example_dsh_service](example_dsh_service) is a simple example of a service that uses the DSH SDK. It demonstrates how to create an app, consume data from Kafka, and how to build and deploy the service to DSH.

## Docker
The [docker](docker) directory contains a docker-compose file that can be used for local development. The docker-compose file starts a Kafka cluster, a Zookeeper instance and a schema registry.
