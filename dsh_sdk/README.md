See [migration guide](https://github.com/kpn-dsh/dsh-sdk-platform-rs/wiki/Migration-guide-(v0.4.X-%E2%80%90--v0.5.X)) for more information on how to migrate from 0.4.X to 0.5.X.

## Description
This library can be used to interact with the DSH Platform. It is intended to be used as a base for services that will be used to interact with DSH. Features include:
- Connect to DSH 
- Fetch Kafka Properties and certificates
- Rest API Token Fetcher (to be used with [dsh_rest_api_client](https://crates.io/crates/dsh_rest_api_client))
- MQTT Token Fetcher
- Common functions 
  - Preconfigured RDKafka client config
  - Preconfigured Reqwest client config (for schema store)
- Graceful shutdown
- Prometheus Metrics (web server and re-export of metrics crate)
- Dead Letter Queue (experimental)

### Note
Rdkafka and thereby this library is dependent on CMAKE. Make sure it is installed in your environment and/or Dockerfile where you are compiling.
See [dockerfile](../example_dsh_service/Dockerfile) for an example.

## Usage
To use this SDK with the default features in your project, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:
  
```toml
[dependencies]
dsh_sdk = "0.5"
```

However, if you would like to use only specific features, you can specify them in your Cargo.toml file. For example, if you would like to use only the bootstrap feature, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:
  
```toml
[dependencies]
dsh_sdk = { version = "0.5", default-features = false, features = ["rdkafka"] }
rdkafka = { version =  "0.37", features = ["cmake-buld", "ssl-vendored"] }
```

See [feature flags](#feature-flags) for more information on the available features.

To use this SDK in your project
```rust
use dsh_sdk::DshKafkaConfig;
use rdkafka::consumer::{Consumer, StreamConsumer};
use rdkafka::ClientConfig;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>{
    // get a rdkafka consumer config for example
    let consumer: StreamConsumer = ClientConfig::new().dsh_consumer_config().create()?;
}
```

## Connect to DSH
The SDK is compatible with running in a container on a DSH tenant, on DSH System Space, on a machine with Kafka Proxy/VPN or on a local machine to a local Kafka. 
See [CONNECT_PROXY_VPN_LOCAL](CONNECT_PROXY_VPN_LOCAL.md) for more info.

## Feature flags
See the [migration guide](https://github.com/kpn-dsh/dsh-sdk-platform-rs/wiki/Migration-guide-(v0.4.X-%E2%80%90--v0.5.X)) for more information on the changes in feature flags since the v0.5.X update.
