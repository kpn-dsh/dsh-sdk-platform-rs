//! # Dead Letter Queue
//! This optional module contains an implementation of pushing unprocessable/invalid messages towards a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ).
//! It is implemeted with [rdkafka] and [tokio].
//!
//! ## Feature flag
//! Add feature `dlq` to your Cargo.toml to enable this module.
//!
//! ### NOTE:
//! This module is meant for pushing messages towards a dead/retry topic only, it does and WILL not handle any logic for retrying messages.
//! Reason is, it can differ per use case what strategy is needed to retry messages and handle the dead letters.
//!
//! It is up to the user to implement the strategy and logic for retrying messages.
//!
//! ## How to use
//! 1. Implement the [ErrorToDlq] trait on top your (custom) error type.
//! 2. Use the [Dlq::start] in your main or at start of your process logic. (this will start the DLQ in a separate tokio task)
//! 3. Get the dlq [DlqChannel] from the [Dlq::start] method and use this channel to communicate errored messages with the [Dlq] via the [ErrorToDlq::to_dlq] method which is implemented on your Error.
//!
//! The topics are set via environment variables `DLQ_DEAD_TOPIC` and `DLQ_RETRY_TOPIC`.
//!
//! ## Importance of `DlqChannel` in the graceful shutdown procedure
//! The [`Dlq::start`] will return a [`DlqChannel`]. The [`Dlq`] will keep running till the moment [`DlqChannel`] is dropped and finished processing all messages.
//! This also means that the [`Shutdown`] procedure will wait for the [`Dlq`] to finish processing all messages before the application is shut down.
//! This is to make sure that **all** messages are properly processed before the application is shut down.
//!
//! **NEVER** borrow the [`DlqChannel`] but provide the channel as owned/cloned version to your processing logic and **NEVER** keep an owned version in main function, as this will result in a **deadlock** and your application will never shut down.
//! It is fine to start the [`Dlq`] in the main function, but make sure the [`DlqChannel`] is moved to your processing logic.
//!
